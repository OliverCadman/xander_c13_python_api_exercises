"""
In this exercise, you are tasked with making GET, POST, PUT, PATCH 
and DELETE requests to the post resource of the JSON Placeholder API. 

You should think about how they could guard against repeated logic.
When working through your solution, remain aware of any points in which
you are writing repeating logic. Those situations are perfect for re-factoring 
into functions! 

Remember to import the requests library, and to make requests to the 'posts' resource
in the JSON placeholder API.
